## Marketing Assets — RefundGuard MVP

### Loom Script (30 seconds)
Hey [name], I built RefundGuard because I kept losing money to manual refunds. It auto-enforces your policy, saves you hours, and protects your revenue. Want to test it free? I’ll delete it if you don’t love it.

### One-Sentence Pitch
Automate refunds, enforce policies, and stop revenue leaks — in one click.

### Email / DM Template
Subject: Lock in your Whop refunds this week?

Hey [name],

Saw you’re scaling on Whop and wanted to share something I just shipped — RefundGuard.

- Plug in your Whop store once, choose from “No Refunds”, “7-Day Guarantee”, or your own rules.
- Every refund request gets an instant decision, Whop processes approved refunds automatically.
- Denials fire back a friendly template so you keep the relationship while protecting your revenue.

I’m letting a few creators try it free this week. If it doesn’t save you time (or cash), I’ll disable it for you myself.

Want me to spin up an install link?
